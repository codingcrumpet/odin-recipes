    <p>Today we will be looking at making one of my favourite pancake recipes: <em> easy</em> to make, but absolutely <strong>scrumptious!</strong></p>
    <p> This recipe was handed down to me by my great-aunt's mother's sister's fourth friend's pet robot, who taught me the intracacies of following pre-made recipes from Aunt Jemima. </p>
    <h3>Ingredient List</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Flour: 1.5 cups </li>
            <li> Sugar: 0.5 cups </li>
            <li> Salt: 1/2 teaspoon </li>
            <li> Butter: 400 cups </li>
            <li> Milk: 2 dL </li>
            <li> Magic Baking Powder: 14mL</li>
            <li> The Power of Hopes and Dreams</li>
        </ul>


    <h3> Steps</h3> 
        <ol> 
            <li>Gather all of your ingredients</li>
            <li> Put the flour, sugar, salt, and magic baking powder into a giant bowl</li>
            <li> Melt the butter in the microwave (or with a raybeam, whichever you have at hand)</li>
            <li> Pour the butter and milk into that giant bowl</li>
            <li> Whisk an egg; I forgot to add this to the ingredient list, oops ;)</li>
            <li> Add the egg to the giant bowl</li>
            <li> Stir it together, using chopsticks found at the bottom of your lowest cupboard drawer</li>
            <li> Stare at the bowl long and hard, realizing this recipe doesn't seem to make much sense, and begin asking yourself "Where did I go wrong?"</li>
            <li> Check the fridge and realize you have nothing else to eat, give up, and continue with this recipe</li>
            <li> Heat a frying pan or wok over medium heat, adding a touch of cooking oil and butter</li>
            <li> Pour some of whatever it is that's in the bowl into the wok or frying pan</li>
            <li> When you see plenty of bubbles, flip that over</li>
            <li> Wait about..3 minutes? Then check the bottom of the flipped pancake</li>
            <li> Serve with 2 bottles of fake maple syrup, a healthy heap of whipped cream, and the blueberries that have been sitting in the back of your fridge all week that you've been too lazy to eat until now.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!
        </ol>
